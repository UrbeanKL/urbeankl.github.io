Urbean is an urban kitchen with an emphasis on serving the very best coffee.  The idea of Urbean was born out of our very own desire to have a place to stop, have a really good cup of coffee and a fresh, healthy bite to eat in the city. Enjoy taking time out with us here at Urbean 

##Our Coffee 

Here at Urbean we proudly serve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.commonmancoffeeroasters.com/">Common Man Coffee Roasters</a>.
We chose Common Man for our coffee because they care about their bean growers and we really love their coffee. 
 
Our house blend is called 22 Martin and it is 66% Veer Attikan from India and 22% Don Pepe Estate from Panama.  We might be a bit biased, but we think it's the best brew in KL! 

##Our Food

We're passionate about food in Urbean too and we've created a really tasty <a href="#ub-menu">cafe menu</a> with an international flair. We serve all-day breakfast dishes, gourmet sandwiches and hot pastas that are made to order. We also enjoy healthy eats so you'll see a few superfoods and gluten free dishes crop up in our dishes.
