Urbean is an urban kitchen with an emphasis on serving the very best coffee in a warm and welcoming environment.  The idea of Urbean was born out of our very own desire to have a place to stop, have a really good cup of coffee and a fresh, healthy bite to eat in the city. Enjoy taking time out with us here at Urbean. 

##Our Coffee 

We are committed to delivering a great cup of coffee for you to appreciate and enjoy and we constantly look for ways to innovate and grow.  We truly believe in quality without compromise.

Here at Urbean we proudly serve <a target="_blank" href="www.commonmancoffeeroasters.com">Common Man Coffee Roasters</a>.
We chose Common Man for our coffee because they care about their bean growers and we really love their coffee.  
 
Our house blend is called 22 Martin and it’s an equal part three-bean blend from India, Peru and Brazil.  We might be a bit biased, but we think it’s the best brew in KL!  

##Teas and Other Drinks
We love coffee but equally we are passionate about our teas.  We chose loose leaf teas by Five Senses because of their superb quality that is both soothing and aromatic.  Our Premium Hot Chocolate is also by Five Senses as is our delicious and creamy Spiced Chai Latte.
