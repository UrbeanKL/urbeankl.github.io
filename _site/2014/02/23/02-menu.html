<p>We’re passionate about food in Urbean too and we’ve created a really tasty café menu that’s been influenced from our travels abroad. We serve all-day breakfasts, gourmet sandwiches and hot pastas that are made-to-order. We also enjoy healthy eats so you’ll see a few superfoods and gluten free dishes crop up in our menu. There are plenty of options for vegetarians too. Our menu is pork-free.</p>

<p>We are in the midst of updating our menu with more dishes for you. Come back soon!</p>
